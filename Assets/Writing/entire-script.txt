1. Hey, can you hear me? Your camera is looking good—I can see everything. Alright buddy, this is it. Time to make treasure hunting history. Er, 'salvage,' history.

2. So, about that air tank of yours… there's a bit of a leak. You'll wanna top off with whatever air pockets you can find down there. We'll invest in better gear after we become millionaires. 

3. Hey look at that! A doubloon! Spanish gold currency. Fun fact: the word means 'double,' or, double escudo. Reckon they're worth more than double today. 

4. Look out for those jellies—they'll take your breath away. 

5. Back in 1663, before his ship The Fury was smashed on these rocks in a hurricane, the pirate Captain Kelly and his crew controlled these waters. His last big score, among countless other goodies, was a massive haul of silver from his attack on General Guerrero's Spanish fleet. 

Before The Fury sank in a hurricane, Captain Kelly's last big score was a haul of raw silver from the attack on Guerrero. If we can find evidence of The Fury, the silver won't be far.

6. My theory is that the tide pulled the wreckage, and its treasure, into these channels. If we can find evidence of The Fury, the silver won't be far. 

7. Keep an eye out for the things that bite. They'll take your breath for good. 

8. How's the air down there? *laughs* Ah, sorry. For what it's worth, it's scorching up here in this little dinghy. A shame I can't swim. 

9. Gemstones! Diamonds, emeralds—usually luxury items taken from passengers and

pedestrians. 

10. Classic flintlock pistol—priceless artifact. Good find! 

11. Keep a look out for other things, too. Barrels, flags, rope, bottles, pots, debris. All signs

of Kelly and The Fury. 

12. It's getting harder for me to see. Wanna wipe your lens or something? Hope you can

still hear me. 

13. Ah, a cutlass! A stout blade good for close range battle. 

14. Check out that hat! Could've belonged to Captain Kelly himself! We're onto

something. 

15. Looks like you're getting deeper now. Remember—the higher the pressure, the more

oxygen you'll need. 

16. You're the fourth best free-diver I know. If anyone can probably do this, it's you. (area

based)

17. Yeesh. That bone looks recent… Uh… be careful down there. 

18. I can't believe it! The Fury! Check inside! 

19. We did it! The discovery of the century! The payload of a lifetime! 

20. Hey! Can you hear me? What happened! 

21. I'm losing you! I--*static*--Too dark--*static*--Can't see--*static*. 

22. *intermittent static* 

23.  *static* Oh god! What have I done! Condemned my best friend to death! And for what?

Untold fortune?! A galvanized legacy? 

24. Hey! You made it! Enjoy your first breath as a millionaire!

25. Hey can you hear me?

26. Hey there we are. Your camera looks good. I can see everything.

27. Look out for those jellies—they'll take your breath away.

28. Look out for those jellies—they're breathtaking, if you catch my drift.

29. Wish I could join ya. Too bad I can't swim.

30. Back in 1777, the pirate, Captain Robert Kelly, and his crew of ne'er do goods,

controlled this bay in their ship The Fury. They had a short run, but man they had a good

go.

31. Hey, you found a doubloon! Classic Spanish currency in the 18th century. Good find.

32. Kelly and his crew attacked a Spanish fleet lead by the Spanish General Alejandro

Guerrero on their way to Spain out in these waters.

33. Guerrero was escorting a merchant ship loaded with gold, silver, diamonds, emeralds—

the classics. Some fine jewelry and heirlooms from the passengers were lifted by Kelly,

too. The haul is estimated at over thirty million dollars in today's money. At least, that's

what this podcaster I listen to put it at.

34. If it wasn't for a hurricane that sank The Fury and took everyone with it, the treasure

would've been long spent. Pirates were never ones to save.

35. Watch out for the things that bite—they'll take your breath away altogether.

36. Kelly's ship The Fury was said to have chests built into the hull. Imagine if we found the

ship. If it's still there, I'll bet half that's where the majority of the silver will be.

37. It's said that a hurricane smashed The Fury on the rocks before Kelly could unload his

score, and the tide drew most of the wreck—and its treasure—into these caves and

channels.

38. Bear in mind, the deeper you get, the more pressure. The more pressure, the more air

you'll need. Stay sharp.

39. Looks like it's getting darker. Careful down there.

40. Oh this is big, man. The footage alone is worth something!
